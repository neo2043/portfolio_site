          Heyo! I'm Prabhat Kumar, and I'm an embedded systems developer who
          loves turning hardware into smart, responsive systems. My journey into
          embedded development started with a curiosity for how things work
          under the hoodâ€”tinkering with microcontrollers, sensors, and firmware
          quickly evolved into a full-on passion for crafting reliable,
          low-level software that powers real-world devices. Would you believe
          me if my first project was a{" "}

          Fast forward to today, I've worked on everything from real-time
          monitoring systems to power-efficient IoT devices. My current focus is
          on building performant, maintainable firmware and integrating
          hardware-software interfaces that are both robust and scalable. I'm
          also exploring{" "}

          I love working collaboratively with a team, combining our strengths to
          create projects that not only meet user needs but are ones I
          personally enjoy and use. The process of brainstorming,
          problem-solving, and refining ideas with others is something I truly
          value. I'm also passionate about researching and writing about
          technology, whether it's diving deep into new trends, experimenting
          with different tools, or sharing my insights in blog posts.
